# Power-Amplifier-CW-test-program
It is a test automation program of RF and microwave power amplifier(PA) through MATLAB by using Kesight Tech. instruments.
Such as N9030A,N5182A,E3632A...
V1.0 make the constant waveform(CW) signal test of single-branch PA and dual-branch PA(like Doherty architecture)
Measured parameters include Pin,Pout,Pdc;and then the PAE,DE,Gain is calulated.
The following mission is to add Modulated signal test.
